<h2>Game Design Workshop, Chapter 2 The Structure of Games:</h2>
	<br>
		<p align="center">

		The main take away from this chapter for me is that games are very
 different from each other. However regardless of how different they are, games 
share some very common fundamental elements. Games share players meaning that they 
have players. Objectives, meaning that there are goals that the play can achieve to 
win the game. Procedures and Rules indicating what the players have to do, can do, 
and can’t do in order to meet the objectives. Resources of value for the player to 
assist them in meeting their objectives. Conflict forcing players to work against 
each other in order to meet objectives. Boundaries, defining where that game takes 
place. Outcomes, such as a winner or a looser. The chapter does a decent job 
explaining this and comparing Quake to Go Fish in that they both use these elements 
yet they are two totally different games. However, the chapter goes in further to 
discuss concepts that engage the player. Presenting challenges to the player 
creates conflict and tension amongst the player(s). Play is a very important 
concept that the chapter discusses. Play is abstract idea however, is defined as 
the amount of free movement in the world of the game in order to meet objectives 
and meet challenges. Premise is a pretty important element to have in games today 
because it gives the player the feeling that their choices in the game matters and 
has outcomes as the play through the game. It submerges the player in the fantasy 
of the game’s narrative and makes the world more real. Character piggy backs off 
the emotional of the player and in creating a fictional person that the player 
cares for or hates.

<h2>Sigi - A Fart for Melusina</h2>

		<p align="center">

		Is a retro inspired platformer game that follows a knight named Sigi as he hunts for a mermaid named Melusina. This is a platformer game that provides fairly easy gameplay with many levels, bosses, and humor. As I said before the game is a retro inspired and I feel that the makers did a decent job at that. The game definitely feels like a PG-13 Super Mario Bros. style game. The game possesses decent running, jumping, fighting mechanics. Though, I would say that the jumping does feel a bit delayed and disappointing. The player can fight off zombies, skeletons, spiders, snakes, flame throwing plants, birds, bats, and more as they progress through the game. The player has a variety of fighting mechanics from jumping on enemies, to throwing knives, axes, swords, and clubs at enemies through acquiring power ups. However, the I feel that the player is a bit overpowered with the amount of extra lives available to them throughout each level. I will say that the game is very humorous. The victory fart that Sigi makes at the end of each level is priceless. He bends over and just lets one rip. The respawn animation with Sigi pointing his sword to the heavens as a thunder bolt comes crashing down to him as if he were a god is pretty cool. Although the disturbed character Sigi is portrayed as an overweight stalker with a gas problem as he chases the mermaid Melusina across the world. Sigi does also make some…let’s just say interesting comments about the mermaid’s appearance. The game does however have a problem with its replay ability. The game doesn’t offer much incentive to replay it whence the game is complete. However, I would recommend at least one play through if you like platformers.
