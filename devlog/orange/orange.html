<h2>Game Design Workshop: Chapter 3 Working with Formal Elements</h2>
	<br>
		<p align="center">

		In terms of the many “Objectives” that the chapter discussed I feel that it is commonly over looked amongst players on how many little tasks develop into the narrative of a game and enhance the player experience Objectives move the game along like the plot of a story. The found it especially interesting that the “Rules” of a game can loop and keep the game running. Without certain rules in place the game can become broken. It makes you rethink and test your game, and the different combinations of rules more than once. In order to find more fun and effective processes of games. I found the concept of “rules restricting actions” intriguing. Having rules such as a magazine limit makes the player less likely to go guns blazing and think more strategically with their ammo. Which leads into the next topic “Resources.”
Having resources in games that are working for the player and against the player. Currency, Time, Lives, Power-ups, etc. These can change the way players plays the game, the choices they make and the choices that they are able to make. Choice/ Action itself in some games can be a resource. Limiting the number of free lives in Super Mario changes the way players value the lives. Having such elements in a game creates “conflict,” because the player is trying to accomplish the objectives of the game with in the rule with limited resources. They challenge the player. It makes you wonder on how many different combos of these elements that Nintendo went through and thought up to create Super Mario.

<h2>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Multiplayer Beta</h2>

	<br>

		For this game I will be reflecting on the player experience. As a fan of the Call of 
Duty franchise I’ve played and enjoyed nearly all of the franchises title. It is important to note that the version that I played is an early play tested version and not the complete version, hence, the word beta. So, without further delay let’s get down to business. 
Without any doubt in my mind this the most visceral and realistic adaptation of the Call of Duty franchise that I’ve ever played. The Infinity Ward studio team that created the game in collaboration with Ravensoft and Beenox, definitely took time into developing the realistic visuals and physics of the game. Compared to the classic arcade style shooter that the franchise is known for; this game appears to match a more realistic military experience. From the handling and physics of the shooting to the spawning animation. The games very simple mechanics make a very realistic game narrative. 
When you spawn into the match, your player is seen flying in on the chopper arriving to drop of the soldiers into battle. Before in previous titles the player would just spawn in the game. The game also added in the ability to change the rate of bullets that your gun can shoot at any given time. Enabling for a more accurate shot. The player can now open, close, peek through, and storm through doors. Not only making more realistic, but a lot more interesting for players use as a strategic resource for hunting enemy players.
Just to name a few of my favorites, however, the game offers many more that I haven’t mentioned.Now let’s discuss the features that I hope the studio will implement. Again, the game is an unfinished version and isn’t complete. The weapons gunsmith system without a doubt have a broader surplus of customization options, however I would hope the developers would add more attachments into each category. Increasing the options even more. However, the beta was probably limited any way. I do like the removal of the mini map. The average soldier doesn’t have a map telling him where everything is at. I do think that equipment regeneration perk is way over powered. I mean infinite claymores is ridiculous. I absolutely enjoyed this game and it is in my opinion the best title the past 6 years. I
definitely would add more weapons. I loved the idea of adding more players in a multiplayer match.
